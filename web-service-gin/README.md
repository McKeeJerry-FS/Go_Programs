# Simple Albums API (written in Golang)
This is my first attmept at writing  an API using Golang. The tutorial that was used as the research for the project can be found in Golang's documentation on their site. 

## Imports used in the API
Two imports were used in the creation of the API: 

	* net/http
	* github.com/gin-gonic/gin

	

**net/http**:
this import provides HTTP client and server implementations

**github.com/gin-gonic/gin**: 
this is a framework used to build web applictaion and microservices. This Framework provided features like routing and needed middleware.
